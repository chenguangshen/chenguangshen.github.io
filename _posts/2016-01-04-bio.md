I joined Facebook as a Research Scientist in Jan. 2017.
</p>

<p>
I obtained my PhD and MS in computer science from <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a> in 2016 and 2014, respectively. At UCLA I was a member of the <a href="http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Networked and Embedded Systems Lab</a> led by <a href="http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/person/show/1" target="_blank">Prof. Mani Srivastava</a>. 
Previously I graduated with a B.Eng in software engineering from <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Fudan University</a> in 2012.

<p>
I love building systems to solve problems in mobile computing and the Internet of Things, with a focus on security and privacy, machine learning, and energy efficiency.
