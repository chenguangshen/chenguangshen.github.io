Hi there! I am a 4th year PhD student in computer science at <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA</a>, where I am a member of the <a href="http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Networked and Embedded Systems Lab</a> led by <a href="http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu/person/show/1" target="_blank">Prof. Mani Srivastava</a>. 
Previously I obtained my M.S. in computer science from UCLA in 2014, and my B.Eng in software engineering from <a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Fudan University</a> in 2012. 
</p>

<p>
I love building systems to solve problems in mobile computing and the Internet of Things, with topics on context awareness, energy efficiency, machine learning, and security and privacy. 
<!-- I have done internships at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/serg/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a> during summer 2014 and spring 2015.  -->
